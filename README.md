# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv5

This project demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model with a webcam feed. The steps include installing dependencies, loading the YOLOv5 model, performing detection on static images, and integrating real-time detection with a webcam.

## Install and Import Dependencies

First, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies:

```bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 

# Navigate to the YOLOv5 folder
%cd yolov5

# Install required dependencies for YOLOv5
!pip install -r requirements.txt
Next, import the necessary Python libraries for the project:

python
Copy code
import torch  # Load the YOLO model and make detections
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt  # Visualize images
import numpy as np  # Handle array transformations
import cv2  # Access webcam and render feeds
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow  # Display images in Google Colab
Load the YOLOv5 Model
The YOLOv5 model can be loaded from the PyTorch Hub. Below is an example of how to load the pre-trained YOLOv5s model:

python
Copy code
# Load the YOLOv5 model
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')

# Display the model architecture
model
Make a Detection
To test the model, let's perform object detection on an example image:

python
Copy code
# Load an example image from a URL
img = 'https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg'

# Run the detection
results = model(img)

# Print detection results
results.print()

# Visualize the detection
%matplotlib inline
plt.imshow(np.squeeze(results.render()))
plt.show()
Real-Time Detection with Webcam
You can also use YOLOv5 to perform real-time object detection with a webcam feed. Hereâ€™s how:

Initialize the Webcam
python
Copy code
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open the default camera

# Check if the webcam is opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Camera could not be opened.")
    exit()

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Exit if no frame is captured
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to grab frame")
        break

    # Display the webcam feed
    cv2.imshow('Camera Feed', frame)

    # Exit on pressing 'q'
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Perform Real-Time Detection
Incorporate the YOLOv5 model into the webcam feed for real-time detection:

python
Copy code
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open the default camera

while cap.isOpened(): 
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        break

    # Perform detection on the current frame
    results = model(frame)

    # Display the results
    cv2.imshow('YOLO', np.squeeze(results.render()))

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(10) & 0xFF == ord('q'):  
        break

# Release resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Display Webcam Feed without Detection
If you want to display the webcam feed without performing any detection:

python
Copy code
cv2.imshow('YOLO', frame)  # Display the webcam feed as is
Conclusion
This project showcases the usage of YOLOv5 for both static image detection and real-time object detection using a webcam. You can modify the code to fit your specific use case, including switching to other YOLOv5 models, adjusting detection thresholds, or integrating this with other machine learning pipelines.
